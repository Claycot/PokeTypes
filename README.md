# PokeTypes
Simple program to output effectiveness of Pokemon move types.
Move effectiveness is as of the most recent Pokemon version.

The program can be run with command line arguments, or with the CLI.
The basic input type is...

Command line (Argument-based)
<Name of Program> <Attack type> <Defending type 1> <Defending type 2 (Optional)>

Command line interface (Direct)
<Attack type> <Defending type 1> <Defending type 2 (Optional)>

Please reach out to me with any comments, criticisms, or improvements.
